# JellyFishDetection
The aim of this project is to develop a computer vision system capable of detecting type of jellyfish in underwater images and videos. This system will assist in monitoring jellyfish populations and their movements, which is crucial for ecological studies, marine safety, and tourism management.
Data Collection:

Gather a diverse dataset of underwater images and videos featuring various species of jellyfish in different environments and lighting conditions.
Annotate the dataset with bounding boxes or segmentation masks to label the jellyfish instances accurately.
Preprocessing:

Enhance image quality using techniques like contrast adjustment, noise reduction, and color correction to handle underwater image challenges.
Normalize and resize images to a consistent format suitable for model training.
Model Selection:

Evaluate and choose appropriate object detection models such as Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), or SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector).
Consider implementing segmentation models like U-Net or Mask R-CNN for more precise jellyfish delineation.
Training and Validation:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets ensuring a balanced distribution of jellyfish species and environmental conditions.
Train the selected models using the training set while tuning hyperparameters to improve performance.
Validate the models on the validation set to monitor for overfitting and adjust training procedures accordingly.
The Classes of JellyFish used are 
1. Moon JellyFish
2. Mauve Stinger Jelly fish
3. Lions Mane Jelly Fish
4. Compass Jelly Fish
5. Blue Jelly Fish
6. Barrel Jelly fish
